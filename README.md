# Efood_BI_deliverables
Accompanying code for EF BI task

This repo contains several sql queries which were used to generate the entirety of the results
included in the two preliminary reports submitted via email for the EF BI task.

The sql queries contain comments and are self explanatory.
They are optimised, tested and working on the Google Big Query Engine and may not be 100% compatible
with legacy SQL. Direct links to the queries are also shared to allow direct access to the queries.
The links are contained in the query links file, included in this repository.
